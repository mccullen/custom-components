CT CHEST

History: "54 yo F with >50 PYH smoking, quit 3 years ago. Approaching age 55,
meets candidacy for lung cancer screening. Please eval"

Technique: CT without contrast from the lung apices through the upper abdomen
with coronal, sagittal, and axial MIP reformats. (DLP 95 mGy-cm).

Comparison: None.

FINDINGS:
Exam limited by noncontrasted technique.

Thyroid: Bilateral thyroid nodules, the largest in the isthmus measuring 11 mm.

Lungs, Airways: Upper lobe predominant emphysema.

Well-demarcated solid pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe measuring 8.2 mm
x 4.7 mm x 4.7 mm (axial series 2, image 317 and series 602, image 71).

Multiple other bilateral sub-6 mm solid pulmonary nodules are seen (SE2, images
95, 250, 312, 334, and 417).

Bilateral calcified granulomas. Central airways are patent without endobronchial
mass or debris.

Pleura: No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

Heart, Great Vessels, Mediastinum: Heart and great vessels are unremarkable. No
pericardial effusion. Normal diameter of the aorta and main pulmonary artery.
Multivessel coronary artery calcifications.

Visualized Upper Abdomen: Small hiatal hernia. There are no focal abnormalities
in the visualized liver, spleen, pancreas or kidneys. Small splenule. The
visualized adrenal glands are normal.

Vasculature: Mild atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and its major
branches. No aneurysmal dilation.

Chest Wall, Axilla: No adenopathy by size criteria.

Bones: Multilevel degenerative disease. No lytic or blastic process.

Soft Tissues: Calcifications in the bilateral breasts.

IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple solid pulmonary nodules, the largest, in the right upper lobe,
measuring up to 8.2 mm in largest dimension. Other bilateral sub-6 mm solid
pulmonary nodules.

Lung-RADS Category 3: Probably benign. Probably benign finding(s) for which
short term follow up is suggested.

RECOMMENDATION: Low dose nodule follow up chest CT in 6 months.

2. Upper lobe predominant emphysema.

3. Thyroid nodules. Recommend routine thyroid ultrasound.
