# Package Descriptions
* cr: Collection Readers. 
* cc: CAS Consumers. 
* ae: Analysis Engines.
* models: Simple model objects with getters/setters
* services: Anything with business/implementation logic that you may want to stub out. The components (CRs, AEs, CCs) typically just capture the configuration parameters into model objects and delegate the rest of the work to these services.
